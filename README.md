# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project:
- <strong>What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?</strong></br>
The work I did on this project was implementing a deep Q-learning algorithm to find the best possible path on a treasure map to reach the treasure. The code given included an implementation of the pirate maze game, a storage class for each run through the game, and a mostly completed Jupyter Notebook. I finished the notebook by completing the deep Q-leaning algorithm, including choosing between exploration or exploitation, obtaining feedback from the environment, and training the algorithm through many epochs using the feedback.
# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
- <strong>What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?</strong></br>
As a computer scientist, I develop solutions to problems using technology. For example, I may use ML or create an AI to aid in certain jobs, solve problems, or automate tasks. This field matters for almost any field to solve problems, especially recently with ML and AI, which could otherwise not be solved. Computer science and its related fields create the electronic devices around us and the web we use every day (how are you reading this text?).

- <strong>How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?</strong></br>
The first step in my approach to a problem as a computer scientist, and the process used in this course, is to learn as much about the problem as I need to create an attack plan. This may involve learning about the subject, user requirements, or possible implementation issues. Then, I create an outline of how I might implement a solution to the problemâ€”like a diagram or pseudo code. I then develop code and iterate until I have a working solution.

- <strong>What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?</strong></br>
My ethical responsibilities depend on the assignment. Generally, I am responsible for writing secure and non-malicious code which follows local laws (i.e., GDPR). If I am developing in a medical setting, then I have additional ethical responsibilities, such as ensuring anything I develop follows HIPPA compliance. From the learning of this course, I am also responsible for creating unbiased and non-harmful AI.
